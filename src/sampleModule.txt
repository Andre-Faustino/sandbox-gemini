Build a generic "Module Generator" core that could be reused across projects.

Goal:
- Given a module specification string and a set of options, generate:
  1) a file tree
  2) code files
  3) architecture decisions
  4) design patterns explanation
  5) runbook

Constraints:
- Node.js + TypeScript
- Keep it framework-free (no Express)
- Provide a CLI entry point
- Keep code clean and testable
